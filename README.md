# Machine Learning Assignment 02

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the second assignment of the Machine Learning course.

## Contents

- `Subham_24928003_Ass02.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the assignment.

## Steps

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading and inspecting the dataset
3. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Implementing various regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)
6. Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R^2 Score.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed comparison of the performance of different regression models, along with visualizations to support the analysis.
